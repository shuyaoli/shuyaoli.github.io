#### About Me
I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I have the privilege of being co-advised by Profs. [Stephen Wright](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~swright/) and [Jelena Diakonikolas](https://www.jelena-diakonikolas.com/). I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics from the University of Hong Kong in 2020, where I completed my senior thesis under supervision of Prof. [Xiaoming Yuan](https://hkumath.hku.hk/~xmyuan/). I spent a wonderful summer at UCLA in 2019 working with Prof. [Ernest Ryu](https://ernestryu.com/).
