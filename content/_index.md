### About
I am a fourth year PhD student in Computer Sciences at University of Wisconsin, Madison, co-advised by Profs. Stephen Wright and Jelena Diakonikolas. Prior to UW Madison, I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from the University of Hong Kong in 2020. I completed my senior thesis under supervision of Prof. Xiaoming Yuan. I spent a wonderful summer at UCLA in 2019 working with Prof. Ernest Ryu.
