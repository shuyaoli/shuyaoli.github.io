#### About Me
I am a research scientist at Meta. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I had the privilege of being co-advised by Professors [Jelena Diakonikolas](https://www.jelena-diakonikolas.com/) and [Stephen Wright](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~swright/). I received my B.S. in Mathematics from the University of Hong Kong in 2020, where I completed my senior thesis under the supervision of Prof. [Xiaoming Yuan](https://hkumath.hku.hk/~xmyuan/). I spent a wonderful summer at UCLA in 2019 working with Prof. [Ernest Ryu](https://ernestryu.com/).

#### Research
I am currently working on recommendation systems. My [doctoral research](https://www.proquest.com/docview/3245555001) was at the intersection of optimization and computational learning theory, where I developed algorithms that guarantee various forms of robustness.

Here is a list of my publications:
