#### About Me
I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I have the privilege of being co-advised by Profs. Stephen Wright and Jelena Diakonikolas. I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics from the University of Hong Kong in 2020, where I completed my senior thesis under supervision of Prof. Xiaoming Yuan. I spent a wonderful summer at UCLA in 2019 working with Prof. Ernest Ryu.

#### Research
My research interests are in optimization and machine learning theory. I currently focus on developing machine learning algorithms that uphold various forms of robustness. 

Here is a list of my publications. 


- **Robust Second-Order Nonconvex Optimization and Its Application to Low Rank Matrix Sensing**  
Shuyao Li, Yu Cheng, Ilias Diakonikolas, Jelena Diakonikolas, Rong Ge, Stephen Wright  
To appear, NeurIPS 2023, arXiv coming soon

- **A Randomized Algorithm for Nonconvex Minimization With Inexact Evaluations and Complexity Guarantees**  
Shuyao Li, Stephen Wright  
Manuscript, arXiv coming soon
